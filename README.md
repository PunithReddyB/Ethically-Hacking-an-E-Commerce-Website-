# CyberSecurity and Ethical Hacking Certification Project

## Overview

This project involves ethically hacking an e-commerce website to assess its security vulnerabilities. The process includes network scanning, packet capturing, and vulnerability analysis using various tools and techniques.

## Requirements

- **Virtual Machine (VM)**: Set up and start the VM with Kali Linux.
- **Tools**: `nmap`, `tcpdump`, `dirb`, `curl`, `wget`, and `Nikto`.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Start the Virtual Machine:**

   Boot up the virtual machine where you have Kali Linux installed. Ensure that your VM is connected to the network.

2. **Access the Target Website:**

   Open the web browser within your VM and navigate to the target e-commerce website.

## Steps to Perform the Assessment

### 1. Network Scanning with Nmap

Start by scanning the network to identify open ports and services running on the target machine:

```bash
nmap -O -p- -sV 192.168.22.207


-O: Detects the operating system.
-p-: Scans all ports.
-sV: Detects service versions.
2. Packet Capturing with Tcpdump
Capture network packets to analyze traffic:

bash
Copy code
tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
Replace eth0 with the appropriate network interface if necessary.

## 3. Directory and File Scanning with Dirb
Scan the website for hidden files and directories:

bash
Copy code
dirb http://192.168.22.207
## 4. Homepage Analysis with Curl
Analyze the homepage for information:

bash
Copy code
curl -I http://192.168.22.207
The -I flag fetches the headers only.

## 5. Downloading Website Contents with Wget
Download website contents for offline analysis:

bash
Copy code
wget -r -np -k http://192.168.22.207
-r: Downloads recursively.
-np: Prevents downloading files from parent directories.
-k: Converts links for offline viewing.

## 6. Vulnerability Scanning with Nikto
Scan the web server for vulnerabilities:

bash
Copy code
nikto -h http://192.168.22.207
Notes
Ensure all testing is performed in a controlled environment and authorized by the appropriate parties.
Document all findings and observations during the assessment process.
